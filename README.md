I am not an engineer. I am a self-taught programmer with over 20 years of hands-on experience designing, developing, and implementing applications using various programming languages.

Over the last years, I have done the full-time thing.
Built cloud stuff on Google Cloud Platform, wrangled Jira tickets, reviewed code, attended meetings that should have been emails.
Good, but not great.

I quit because I'm only fully awake when I am building my things, not someone else's roadmap.
